##Secret Family Recipes Cookbook
##PROJECT NAME
- Secret Family Recipes Cookbook
##DESCRIPTION
- Pitch: Anyone can go out and buy a cookbook these days, but I want a place to store all my secret family recipes, handed down from generation to generation. The little cards my grandma wrote the recipes on in her beautiful cursive are getting lost or are hard to read. I need somewhere secure to keep my recipes with me at all times!

##MVP:
- [x]  You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.
- [x]  Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the "Responsiveness" portion of your rubric for more information on this.
- [ ]  The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.
- [x]  Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".
- [x]  For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is working on.
- [x]  Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.
- [x]  For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another's socials/Github.
